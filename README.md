# Monster Hunter: Rise Scripts
This is my collection of REFramework scripts I've made for Monster Hunter: Rise. I'm one of the developers who worked on REFramework's scripting system so these scripts are mostly to showcase what the system is capable of.

All scripts in this repo are MIT licensed.

## Scripts
* `weapon_stay_big.lua` - Stops weapons from shrinking when sheathed or on your back. [Nexus Mods Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/39)
* `monster_has_hp_bar.lua` - Adds a health bar to the top of your screen for the nearest large monster. [Nexus Mods Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterrise/mods/43)

## Installation
Most scripts can be installed by just dropping them into your REFramework `/autorun` directory. 

`monster_has_hp_bar.lua` also requires my [REFramework-D2D](https://github.com/cursey/reframework-d2d) plugin.
